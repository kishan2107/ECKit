##Notes About ECKit
Here's some VERY notable things about ECKit:

1. ECKit No Longer FULLY Supports IE 6/7/8 As of 2.0, but most features will still work.
2. ECKit is worked on daily, so you can expect plenty of new features with every release.
3. ECKit as of date has had no found bug to date.
4. ECKit uses other projects of ECWS that are still not on GitHub or SourceForge, but expect them soon.

##Other
If you have any questions head to [GitHub] (https://github.com/ElijahCruzWebServices/ECKit) and head to our issues.

##Contributing
If you would like to contribute, send us a pull request on GitHub only. Bitbucket and Sourceforge are NOT accepted as we do not look at those currently.
We do not look at these as we do all our collaborating on GitHub.

Also we are going to turn the docs into a wiki if you would like to help create that as well.

##Note
The ECKit team is currently using LESS for building ECKit. We will be upgrading to Sass instead.
